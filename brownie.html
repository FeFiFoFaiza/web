   <p> They're blondies but with chocolate. If you just want blondies click <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/blondies-3409068"> here</a>, though I'll have to warn you. I have no idea how that recipe turns out. This recipe makes 15-20 brownies. </p>
   <h3> Ingredients: </h3>
   <ul> 
     <li> 245g dark chocolate broken into squares or roughly chopped </li>
     <li> 200g butter, diced, plus extra for greasing </li>
     <li> 175g caster sugar </li>
     <li> 125g light soft brown sugar </li>
     <li> 4 large eggs, lightly beaten </li>
     <li> 2 tsp vanilla extract </li>
     <li> 115g plain flour </li>
     <li> Pinch of salt </li>
     <li> 100g dark chocolate, chopped into small chunks (optional) </li>
   </ul>
   <h3> Steps: </h3>
   <ol>
     <li> Preheat the oven to 356°F. Grease and line a 11 x 9in cake tin with baking parchment. </li>
     <li> Put the chocolate and butter into a large heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water (don’t let the bottom of the bowl touch the water underneath) and leave until melted, stirring occasionally (see Tips). </li>
     <li> Remove from the heat and cool the chocolate down by whisking in the sugars using a balloon whisk. Add the eggs and vanilla extract and mix in with a wooden spoon until combined. Sift over the flour and salt and stir again until smooth and combined. Pour into the prepared tin, smoothing the top level. </li>
     <li> Bake for 35–40 minutes, until cracked around the edges and soft in the middle (it will firm up as it cools), rotating the tin halfway through baking. </li>
     <li> If you are adding the chocolate chunks, take the brownie out of the oven after 20 minutes and throw the chunks of chocolate at the half-baked brownie so they break the surface. Return to the oven for the remaining cooking time. </li>
     <li>Transfer the brownie to a wire rack and leave it to cool in the tin, then cut into squares before serving. Once cooled, the brownies will keep in an airtight container for up to a week. Alternatively, cool the cooked brownie in the tin for 10 minutes, then cut into squares and serve warm. </li>
   </ol>
   <h4> Tips </h4>
   <p> If you prefer, put the chocolate and butter into a heatproof bowl, cover (leaving a small air gap) and melt in the microwave on high for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. These brownies also freeze well for up to a month. Simply wrap them tightly in cling film and freeze, then thaw at a cool room temperature before serving. </p>

   <p> I am a female homo sapien who cannot cook. At all. I literally can only make an omelette, everything else just gets burnt. Surprisingly enough, I'm far better at baking. It's probably because the oven does all the work really. But regardless, I know have some somewhat good recipes of dessert stuff. To be honest though, I hate baking too. Cleaning up is so much and I'm far too lazy to do all that.</p>
