          It's a plain vanilla cake but spongey. This makes either one or two
          cakes, depends on the sizes of your pans.

        <p>
          I am a female homo sapien who cannot cook. At all. I literally can
          only make an omelette, everything else just gets burnt. Surprisingly
          enough, I'm far better at baking. It's probably because the oven does
          all the work really. But regardless, I know have some somewhat good
          recipes of dessert stuff. To be honest though, I hate baking too.
          Cleaning up is so much and I'm far too lazy to do all that.
