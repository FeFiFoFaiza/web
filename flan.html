   <p> It's like custard pudding but solid. This recipe makes one gigantic flan which you can either eat by yourself or share with people, serving sizes don't matter when you're hungry. If you don't like flan for some odd reason, you can make <a href="https://www.ricardocuisine.com/en/recipes/633-creme-caramel"> this </a> instead. It's basically flan, but with a different, more fancier name so maybe now you'll like it. </p>
