          It's like custard pudding but solid. This recipe makes one gigantic
          flan which you can either eat by yourself or share with people,
          serving sizes don't matter when you're hungry. If you don't like flan
          for some odd reason, you can make
          <a href="https://www.ricardocuisine.com/en/recipes/633-creme-caramel"
            >this</a
          >
          instead. It's basically flan, but with a different, more fancier name
          so maybe now you'll like it.

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>3 large eggs</li>
          <li>1 cup sugar</li>
          <li>1 14 oz can of condensed milk</li>
          <li>1 12 fl oz can of evaporated milk</li>
          <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F.</li>
          <li>
            In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, melt sugar until
            liquefied and golden in color. Carefully pour hot syrup into a 9
            inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the
            bottom and sides. Set aside. It's going to harden but it'll be soft
            again when you cook the flan because heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, beat eggs. Beat in condensed milk, evaporated milk
            and vanilla until smooth. Pour egg mixture into baking dish. Cover
            with aluminum foil.
          </li>
          <li>Bake in preheated oven 60 minutes. Let cool completely.</li>
          <li>
            To serve, carefully invert on serving plate with edges when
            completely cool.

        <p>
          I am a female homo sapien who cannot cook. At all. I literally can
          only make an omelette, everything else just gets burnt. Surprisingly
          enough, I'm far better at baking. It's probably because the oven does
          all the work really. But regardless, I know have some somewhat good
          recipes of dessert stuff. To be honest though, I hate baking too.
          Cleaning up is so much and I'm far too lazy to do all that.
