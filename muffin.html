   <p> It's a cupcake with no frosting but with fruit. Sure you can use chocolate chips instead, but why would you do that when you can trick your brain into thinking you're eating healthy. Just <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-benefits-of-blueberries">look</a> at all the benefits of blueberries! </p>
   <h3> Ingredients: </h3>
   <ul> 
     <li> 4 tbsp all purpose flour </li>
     <li> 2 tbsp sugar </li>
     <li> 1/8 tsp baking powder </li>
     <li> 1/16 tsp baking soda </li>
     <li> 3 tbsp milk </li>
     <li> 1 tbsp vegetable oil </li>
     <li> 1 tbsp blueberries , fresh or frozen </li>
   </ul>
   <h3> Topping </h3>
   <ul>
     <li> 1 tbsp butter, cold and hard like frozen fish </li>
     <li> 1 1/2 tbsp all purpose flour </li>
     <li> 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar, regular normal old white sugar can work too I guess </li>
     <li> 1/4 tsp vanilla extract  </li>
   <h3> Steps: </h3>
   <ol>
     <li> In a microwave safe mug mix together the first 6 ingredients until smooth. </li>
     <li>Mix in the blueberries. </li>
     <li> In a small bowl, rub together the topping ingredients with a fork until butter pieces resemble bread crumbs. And sprinkle that stuff on top of the batter. </li>
     <li> Microwave for 1 minute or until it is firm to the touch on top. </li>
   </ol>

   <p> I am a female homo sapien who cannot cook. At all. I literally can only make an omelette, everything else just gets burnt. Surprisingly enough, I'm far better at baking. It's probably because the oven does all the work really. But regardless, I know have some somewhat good recipes of dessert stuff. To be honest though, I hate baking too. Cleaning up is so much and I'm far too lazy to do all that.</p>
