   <p> To be honest, I don't understand what chocolate pudding is. It doesn't taste like chocolate really and it basically is a mousse. But apparently there is a <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-mousse-and-pudding-word-of-mouth-216998">difference</a> between those two? </p>
   <h3> Ingredients: </h3>
   <ul> 
     <li> 3 tbsp bittersweet chocolate chips </li>
     <li> 1 tsp cornstarch </li>
     <li> 1/8 tsp salt </li>
     <li> 1 tsp vanilla extract </li>
     <li> 4 large eggs, lightly beaten </li>
     <li>1/2 cup full fat milk </li>
   </ul>
   <h3> Steps: </h3>
   <ol>
     <li> In a large microwavable mug mix in the chocolate and cornstarch. Pour in the salt, vanilla and milk and stir </li>
     <li> Microwave for 1 minutes, then whisk with a fork. Microwave for another 30 seconds and whisk again. It should starting to thicken depending on your microwave ofcourse. </li>
     <li> Continue microwaving for short intervals (15 seconds-ish) until it is nice and thick (always keep a close eye on your mug meals so they don't over heat or over flow) </li>
   </ol>

   <p> I am a female homo sapien who cannot cook. At all. I literally can only make an omelette, everything else just gets burnt. Surprisingly enough, I'm far better at baking. It's probably because the oven does all the work really. But regardless, I know have some somewhat good recipes of dessert stuff. To be honest though, I hate baking too. Cleaning up is so much and I'm far too lazy to do all that.</p>
