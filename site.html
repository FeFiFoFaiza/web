   <p> This site contains three very very <i>very</i> basic dessert recipes. I can't cook at all which is why there are only dessert recipes here. I honestly had no clue which three recipes I should do so I just chose randomly. These recipes should work, I mean, they worked for me. If you do make disastrous desserts using these recipes, that's not my fault. You probably did something wrong. Go check your ingredients and your oven. It definitely, 100% is your oven.  </p>

   <p> I am a female homo sapien who cannot cook. At all. I literally can only make an omelette, everything else just gets burnt. Surprisingly enough, I'm far better at baking. It's probably because the oven does all the work really. But regardless, I know have some somewhat good recipes of dessert stuff. To be honest though, I hate baking too. Cleaning up is so much and I'm far too lazy to do all that.</p>
