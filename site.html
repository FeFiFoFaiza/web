   <p> This site contains some very very <i>very</i> basic dessert recipes. I can't cook at all which is why there are only dessert recipes here. I honestly had no clue which recipes I should do so I just chose randomly. Some of these are mug cake recipes because honestly, who has time to make a whole batch when you just want to make some for yourself. Not to mention it's faster this way. These recipes should work, I mean, they worked for me. If you do make disastrous desserts using these recipes, that's not my fault. You probably did something wrong. Go check your ingredients and your oven/microwave. It definitely, 100% is your oven.  </p>

   <p> I am a female homo sapien who cannot cook. At all. I literally can only make an omelette, everything else just gets burnt. Surprisingly enough, I'm far better at baking. It's probably because the oven does all the work really. But regardless, I know have some somewhat good recipes of dessert stuff. To be honest though, I hate baking too. Cleaning up is so much and I'm far too lazy to do all that.</p>
