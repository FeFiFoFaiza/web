   <p> Because who needs snickerdoodle cookies when you can just turn it into a mug cake? For some odd reason there's also <a href="https://www.averiecooks.com/snickerdoodle-bread/"> snickerdoodle bread</a>. I honestly have no idea why that exists. Who does that to bread? That's just horrible. </p>
   <h3> Ingredients: </h3>
   <ul> 
     <li> 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp all-purpose flour </li>
     <li> 2 tbsp sugar </li>
     <li> 1/4 tspn baking powder </li>
     <li> 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon </li>
     <li> 1/4 cup milk </li>
     <li> 2 tbsp butter </li>
     <li> 1/2 tsp vanilla extract </li>
     <li> Pinch of salt </li>
   </ul>
   <h3> Topping/Layering </h3> 
   <ul>
    <li> 1 tsp sugar </li>
    <li> 1/4 tsp cinnamon </li>
  </ul>
   <h3> Steps: </h3>
   <ol>
     <li> In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and cinnamon until thoroughly, completely combined, with no streaks of any ingredients remaining. Blend in milk, butter, and vanilla until batter is smooth. Into a 14-ounce (or larger) microwave-safe mug with straight sides, scoop a big spoonful of batter, then sprinkle with a spoonful of cinnamon sugar. Alternate layers, ending with cinnamon sugar. </li>
     <li> Microwave on high for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or until cake is done since all microwaves are unique and have their own quirks like people. Eat it hot and burn your tongue or wait for it to cool down. </li>
   </ol>

   <p> I am a female homo sapien who cannot cook. At all. I literally can only make an omelette, everything else just gets burnt. Surprisingly enough, I'm far better at baking. It's probably because the oven does all the work really. But regardless, I know have some somewhat good recipes of dessert stuff. To be honest though, I hate baking too. Cleaning up is so much and I'm far too lazy to do all that.</p>
